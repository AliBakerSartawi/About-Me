            <p>Writing a short bio is like having 1000 fishes and having to choose no more than a handful...</p>
            <p>But... if it is hard it is not impossible...</p>
            <p>Keep looking forward... that is what I tell myself...</p>
            <p>If today is bleak... tomorrow might hold a brighter sunrise...</p>
            <p>"Never stay down," I tell myself, "Get up and work for it!"</p>
