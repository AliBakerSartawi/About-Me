## About-Me

This is an interactive website shaped as a quiz about a few questions about me.

There are 7 questions... five of them are 'yes' and 'no' questions... the last two are guessing questions that require a loop function.

The website includes some information about me, as well as bullet points of my previous education and experience, and a top-ten list of my favorite foods.
